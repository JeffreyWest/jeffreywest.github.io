<small>Note: these tips originally appeared in my tweet thread, found <a href="https://twitter.com/mathoncbro/status/1378347909217935362">here</a>.</small>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. Start writing early.</h2>

Start a Word document from DAY 1 of the project. Start filling in key literature references, type out key sentences, add sketch of figures. 
</br></br>

The principle: if you fill in details along the way, then holes in the project will stare at you in the face.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">2. Unique ID.</h2>

Pick a unique, SHORT keyword/phrase to identify each project (e.g. “metabolism-immune”). Use this same phrase to name file folders, slack channels, to-do list, github repository, everything.
</br></br>

An organized system helps SO much.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">3. Learn continuously. </h2>

Try to pair a new project with learning a new skill. For example, when starting a recent project I decided to make plots in R to learn a new coding language. 
</br></br>

Skills will accumulate alongside projects.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">4. Re-use. </h2>

Re-use old resources as much as possible. I use Lepton to store code snippets of plotting routines, fitting routines, commonly used functions, etc.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">5. One-to-one. </h2>

Upon submission, have one sub-folder (e.g. independent code scripts) for each figure. 
</br></br>

This helps reproducibility and is a huge life-saver when your manuscript comes back from review.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">6. Feedback. </h2>

Pursue continuous feedback from your advisor, as well as peers who are 1-2 years ahead of you. They’ve probably run into the same problems. 
</br></br>

Don’t struggle alone!

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">7. Collaborate & trade. </h2>

Trade skills: teach someone a skill in exchange for learning a skill.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">8. Ask. </h2>

Ask colleagues to share data, resources, code, bibliography files. You might be surprised what others will share for free.
</br></br>

Everyone (and I do mean everyone) in academics is used to cold emails. Go for it.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">9. Schedule your time. </h2>

Schedule time blocks (literally create an event on your calendar) to perform specific tasks.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">10. Daily. </h2>

Do the difficult tasks daily for a short 10-15 minutes, first thing. 
</br></br>

(if reading literature is difficult for you, split it evenly across every weekday).

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">11. Say no. </h2>

You can’t do everything. As you become more productive, others will notice & you’ll be asked to do more things. 
</br></br>

Prioritize.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">12. Don’t drop your old project once it’s finished. </h2>
	
Try to connect it to EVERYTHING. 
</br></br>

At first, it might seem self-serving (“look at me!”), but science is all about making connections.
</br></br>

Iterate your knowledge.

</br></br>
<h2 class="section-heading">13. Become known as the “something” guy or gal. </h2>

If you have a strong research interest, make it known. Others will send you links to papers, blogs, & resources on that topic.

</br></br>

I don't measure up to all of these (especially, #11, lol!), but we are all in progress :)
</br></br>

Happy sciencing!
