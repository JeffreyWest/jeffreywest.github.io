<h2 class="section-heading">Lindy Talk</h2>
I've recently had the opportunity to discuss my research in math oncology on the podcast called <a href="https://paulskallas.substack.com/">LindyTalk</a>. 

</br></br>
My conversation with Paul Skallas, AKA the <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulSkallas">Lindyman</a>, spanned the breadth of evolution & ecology in cancer. 
The podcast is a more of a generalist podcast (not specific to cancer), so our conversation focused more layman's understanding of evolution, and how evolutionary principles can be useful in designing cancer treatment.
I also mention antifragility and future work that we are doing to design antifragile cancer therapy.
