summary: "A simple concept to unleash a kind of personal atomic energy."
---

The concept of an "atom" is simple: it is the irreducible form of a molecule. This concept can be extended to find the irreducible form of an idea, a thought, or a piece of information. This simple concept has proven quite useful in my ability to collect, apply, and re-use information. Let me explain.

</br></br>
I'm an academic - that carries with it a TON of reading. I want to act on my newly acquired knowledge. I want to minimize the danger of losing those new ideas.

</br></br>
To ensure this, I am developing a note-taking system to help organize, retain, and ultimately apply the knowledge I'm gaining.
</br></br>
<h3>Atomic Notes</h3>
I've recently adopted a note-taking style called "atomic notes" where each note is a single, irreducible concept. These notes are designed to be re-used. A good atomic note would be a defining a key concept or term, or summarizing the main result of paper. For an example set of atomic notes based on a recent talk, see this <a href="https://twitter.com/mathoncbro/status/1336333945391091713">tweet</a>.
</br></br>
I currently take notes in an app called <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. Most note-taking apps implicitly assume that a "page" is the atomic unit - but Roam Research explicitly encourages using a single line (called a "block") as the atomic unit.
</br></br>
I love Roam Research. However, my key realization was not that Roam is 10x better than every other software - it was that I haven't been using a note-taking software of any kind!
</br></br>
I used to read papers while in the "Literature Review" phase of a project. You know, when writing the Introduction of a paper, long after the Results have been finalized. 
</br></br>
Atomic notes allow me to read papers regularly, writing atomic notes to be re-used later for an unspecified project. I re-use them readily because they are written in my own words (no danger of plagiarizing the original paper).
</br></br>
<h3>Atomic Posts</h3>
Similarly, I am embarking on a new goal to write "atomic blog posts." These will undoubtedly consist of atomic notes connected together into a cohesive argument about a single, irreducible concept.
</br></br>
I think this style of blogging will lead to more discussion. Atomic posts have natural boundaries in the scope of topic, encouraging more pointed and direct feedback. 
</br></br>
It will also encourage me to publish sooner. I do not need to consider every caveat and implication. I only need to frame the idea, and distill its explanation to achieve clarity. Atomic posts bring freedom to write, and to publish.
</br></br>
This idea is based on recent "atomic essays" posted on Twitter under the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ship30for30&src=typeahead_click">#ship30for30</a>, a writing course of <a href="https://twitter.com/dickiebush">@dickiebush</a>. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ship30for30&src=typeahead_click">here</a> to view some of the examples on Twitter. 
</br></br>
Can we replicate this concept in academics? I think so.
</br></br>

<h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
The final atomic piece of the puzzle is habit creation.
</br></br>
In his book entitled "Atomic Habits," James Clear begins page 1 with a definition of both words:</br></br>
<ul>
<li><b>atomic</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>an extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system</li>
		<li>the source of immense energy or power</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</br>
<li><b>habit</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

From the very first page, the concept clicks. Intentional habits that are routinely employed can sum up to immense potential - even if those habits are very tiny.

<h3>Atomic Lifestyle</h3>
I'd like to begin an "atomic habit" to regularly create "atomic notes" which will facilitate "atomic posts" on my blog. My hope is that this routine will unleash a kind of atomic energy, which laid previously untapped.
