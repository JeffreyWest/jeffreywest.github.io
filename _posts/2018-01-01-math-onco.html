The purpose of this weekly(ish) email is to consolidate the important updates in the field of mathematical oncology into one, distilled form of communication. These might be tweets, preprints, post-prints, or even blog posts.
</br></br>
I'd love for this to grow into a community-led project, which is why I'll always include a submit button. Use it to recommend the best science, new or old.
