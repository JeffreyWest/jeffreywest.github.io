Adaptive cancer therapy aims to delay cancer progression by exploiting competition between drug-sensitive and -resistant cells in the tumor. Drug dosing is adapted in a patient-specific fashion to maintain drug-sensitive cells that competitively suppress resistance (blue). This is in contrast to standard-of-care cancer treatment regimens that maximize cell kill and thereby cause the rapid competitive release of drug-resistant cells (orange). But, when will adaptive therapy work? Shown is a collage of so-called “phase plane” visualizations of a mathematical model with which the authors address this question. Each triangle represents a different parameterization. It was found that resource availability, resistance fraction, resistance cost, and cellular turnover integrate to modulate intratumoral competition.
