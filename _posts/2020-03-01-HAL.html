HAL is a Java library that facilitates hybrid modeling (spatial models with interacting agent-based and PDE components, commonly used for oncology modeling). HALâ€™s components can be broadly classified into: on and off-lattice agent containers, finite difference diffusion fields, a GUI building system, and additional tools and utilities for computation and data collection. These components have a standardized interface that expedites the construction of complex models. This library has been used in several PSOC modeling efforts and has facilitated designing and sharing models at Moffitt IMO.
